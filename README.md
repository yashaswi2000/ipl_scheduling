# ipl_scheduling
a approach to schedule ipl matches with a set of constraints as follows

IPL (Indian Premier League) is a popular cricket tournament.
Total 8 teams participate in the tournament. Letâ€™s say Team A - Team H. Each
team belongs to a different city. Each team is supposed to play with the other
team twice.
For example, Team A has to play with Team C, twice, but once in the city
which Team A represents and once in the city which Team C represents.
Write an algorithm to schedule matches for the entire tournament given the
following.
1. For example Team A has to play with Team C, twice, but once in the city
which Team A represents and once in the city which Team C represents.
2. A team cannot play matches on two consecutive days.
3. Every day only one match can be played, except on weekends (Saturday and
Sunday) two games can be played.
